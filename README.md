# Tic-Tac-Toe Tech Test

The Tic Tac Toe script creates the logic behind a game of tic-tac-toe. Tic-tac-toe (or noughts and crosses) is a two-player game in which each user, X and O take turns marking a 3x3 grid. The winner is the player who successfully marks a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row.
